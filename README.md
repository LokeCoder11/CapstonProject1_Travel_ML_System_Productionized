Travel Analytics & MLOps Pipeline

Project Overview
A comprehensive machine learning operations (MLOps) project that revolutionizes travel experience curation through advanced data analytics and predictive modeling. This project demonstrates end-to-end ML pipeline development, from data ingestion to production deployment, using modern DevOps practices.

Business Impact
In the travel and tourism industry, data-driven decision making is crucial for optimizing customer experiences and operational efficiency. This project leverages machine learning to:

Predict flight prices with high accuracy for dynamic pricing strategies
Classify user demographics for targeted marketing campaigns
Recommend personalized hotels to enhance customer satisfaction
Automate ML workflows for continuous model improvement

Dataset Architecture
The project utilizes three interconnected datasets that provide comprehensive travel behavior insights:

1. Users Dataset

code: Unique user identifier
company: Associated company/organization
name: User's full name
gender: User's gender classification
age: User's age demographic

2. Flights Dataset

travelCode: Travel session identifier
userCode: Foreign key linking to Users dataset
from/to: Origin and destination airports
flightType: Service class (economy, business, first)
price: Flight ticket price (target variable)
time: Flight duration
distance: Travel distance in miles/km
agency: Booking agency
date: Travel date

3. Hotels Dataset

travelCode: Travel session identifier
userCode: Foreign key linking to Users dataset
name: Hotel name
place: Hotel location
days: Length of stay
price: Daily rate
total: Total booking cost
date: Check-in date
